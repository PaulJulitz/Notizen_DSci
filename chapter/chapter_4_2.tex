\paragraph{Ideas for next version}
Reference: Superforcasting, Chapter: 10. Leadership Dilemma.
Write down the balance, (false dicodemie) between thinking and decisdion.

Three layers: (Own contruction)
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Greater "model" on what to do, where the one piece fits in.
	\item The reason or motivation behind, what to do. This should allow possible adjustment, on "how to do it."
	\item What to do: "Auftrag". Idealy, this should be measurable or aggreat upon, what coun't as a success.
	\item How to do it.
\end{enumerate}

	The aim of this research is twofold: first, to establish a clear and coherent understanding of the key \gls{p_LR} necessary for realizing a particular vision; and second, to articulate these thoughts in a structured way that allows others to scrutinize, enables team members to evaluate for themselves, or makes it easier for them to comprehend the entire \gls{p_CDF}.\\
	
	This document explores the essential \gls{p_LR} and organizes them into four main areas: \textit{Driver for a Vision}, \textit{Alignment and Decision-Making}, \textit{Finding the Best Solution}, and \textit{A Great Team}. Rather than serving as a rigid guideline, the framework is designed as a personal conceptual model that clarifies the author's expectations and reflections when engaging with leadership responsibilities.\\
	
	This leadership framework offers a comprehensive understanding of the vital responsibilities one must undertake to achieve a vision in dynamic environments.

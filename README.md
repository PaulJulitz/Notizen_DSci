## Newest Study & Research Path
    
    -----------------------------------------------------
	### AI LEARNING GOALS
	- Running X Model
	- Able to use SDK; CLI
	- (Optional) Understanding Neural Networks better

	### Research Sources
	- Person-Cours
	- 3-hours metric cours
	- Azure Certificate: DP-100
	<- Documentation, that I can manage learn those courses

	#### How to Doc
	- LaTex Deep dive -> Take what is usefull or relevant for other people i Markdown (But not before)
	- Emmy_ML_One: Code Repos <- Other Repos in Notes_DSci
	- Topics to explain
	- Design Explation: AutoML, Designer as a first approach -> putting it all into one model
	- Explanation SDK, CLI
	--------------------------------------------------------
	
	# General enviroment file (local enviroments)		
	
	# Learning Basics for SDK, CLI
	- Basic Doc understanding -> LaTex
	- Simple ML-Model Example (Either by Mircosoft Doc or Perscon Example)
		- Start Experiment
		- Train a Model on different compute targets
		- Log Metrics
		- (Maybe) Register Model
		- Test Model
	
	# Exended DevOps Setup
	- Unity data sanity tests
	- Model version
	- Model evaluation
	- (Optional: Deployment)
	
	# automatic CI flake8, mypy (at least) for model script
	- setup envirnoment files, that the ci pipeline can use them,
	- setup ymal file to run CI pipeline for code review test.
	
	# Learn More about Neural Network
